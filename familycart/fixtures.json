Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.",

Always great to see the original cast lineup, and all are on form, some of the newcomers are great here, I'm sure we all have our favourites.\r\n\r\nI do wonder if it had been better if the franchise came to an end here, Scream 4 isn't bad, but it's not a patch on this one. Trouble is, us fans always wanted more.\r\n\r\nThe usual slick production, it's very well put together, with great use of music.",

The film also portrays a fictionalized account of real-life events, including the death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981 and 1982, linking them together and with the affairs of Michael Corleone. Coppola has stated he intended for Part III to be an epilogue to the first two films.",
